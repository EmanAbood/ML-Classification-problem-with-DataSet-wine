# ML-Classification-problem-with-DataSet-wine
project Machine Learning Classification problem using Data set wine
## About Project
During this project I learned more about the calculation process 
of Bayesian Rule Based Classifier to make prediction on a dataset, and 
how to calculate the risk and rejection area of the model.
I learned more about the Na√Øve Bayes classifier, and how to use the 
GaussinNB classification algorithm, how to extract the most important 
features and show them in the decision boundary figure, after that I 
learned more about the KNN classification algorithm and how to apply 
different numbers of training set and different numbers of K, so I 
realized that the KNN algorithm require more time when the number of 
K increased.
